# Surfs_Up

## 1. Overview

Since our investors required more information about the temperatures trends before opening the surf shop, they requested the temperature data for June and December in Oahu, Hawaii. This way, they would determine if the surf ice cream shop business is sustainable in a yearly-round basis.


## 2. Results

- Analysis between June and December temperatures:
  - There are 217 temperatures more registred for December than in June.
  - The mean varies only for 3.9ยบ F, being June, the month with the highest mean out of the two months analyzed.
  - The Standard Deviation is teling us that that both months have a similar dispersion relative to its mean, June has 3.25 and December 3.74. 
  - The minimum temperature differs for 8ยบ F, and being December with the lowest temperature registered as expected with 54ยบ F.
  - If we removed the 217 registered exta temperatures from the December plot, both plots would have a similar bell shaped curve. Confirming that the distributions are not skewed, since the mean and the median are quite similar for both months.

## 3. Summary

Basing our decision for opening a business, only in the temperatures as the key indicator, I would determine that is viable. Even though temperatures recorded in December seem to vary more than those of June, December would still provide appropriate weather conditions for both surfing and demand in ice cream.

However, we would be foolishing ourselves if we only take in consideration the temperatures to open a our business. We would need to also consider precipitation, wave swell and existing competitition to determine the viability of the project.
